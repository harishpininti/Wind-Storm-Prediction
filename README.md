 # Wind-Storm-Prediction
 -->Predicting Windstorm Expected time of arrival of the storm in hours using linear regression,

 -->Evaluate the cost function for each model and determine the gradient descent of
     the Optimum model.
    
----->1.Simple Linear Regression
----->2.MultiLinear Regression.
------>3.Stepwise Regression.



A lot of Work is Needed to Complete in this Prediction.
Will be updated periodically.
